## Clean-me-up

### Preconditions
* The application exposes a public REST end-point for sending emails
* The application acts like a facade towards a legacy email library located in module **clean-me-up-support**
* The current implementation is rather ugly
* The API contract has not yet been published so you don't need to be backwards compatible
* Application is located in module **clean-me-up-rest**
* Don't change the legacy module **clean-me-up-support**

### Assignment
* Refactor the code in module **clean-me-up-rest** as you wish
* When you are done you should be rather happy with the code when it comes to: maintenance, quality, structure, architecture, testing, validation etc
* If you left things behind - please note that down in a read-me file

Estimated time ~4 hours, but feel free to impress us.
