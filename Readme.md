## Clean-me-up

## Comments after completion. 
That is what I think acceptable code is (not perfect, there is always a chance to improve something). 
I left some comments inside. This version is quite close to what I do now (except java version, I use 17th on prod).

### Out of scope 
* Authorization with spring security. 
* Tracing. I would use any of brave/opentracing for production. 
* contract-first approach. 
* CI-pipeline and k8s deployment. 
* Prometheus + grafana dashboards.
